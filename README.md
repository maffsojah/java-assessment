Java (SpringBoot) Coding Assessment
====================================

Project Overview
----------------

An imaginary company called MyWork Holdings Limited is in need of a salaries management system. Currently, they are recording everything on CSV files and Excel sheets. There is need for a system to handle salaries for their employees.

Your Tasks
----------

You are required to develop a system using Java: SpringBoot. The system is required to have the following features:
 
* `User Registraion` - the system should allow admin and ordinary user access.
* `Login` - allow login for registered users
* `Individual Salary Records` - individual entry of salary records and saving to a Database of your choice
* `Bulk Upload of Salary Records` - bulk upload of salary records using csv or excel files
* `PENDING, APPROVED & DECLINED status for salary records` - include approval status on each salary record and allow only the ADMIN to change it
* `Search` - allow searching of records using either approval status, amount, account number, bank or employee name

#### Reporting
* `All Salaries` - develop a simple page that displays the total salaries submitted per day. These can be sorted by date and if they were uploaded in batch, should display the total batch value
* `Pending Transactions` - display transactions which are in PENDING status and awaiting approval by ADMIN


Evaluation Criteria
-------------------

1. Correctness of solution

    Naturally, the project you submit must be functional.  You will also be
    evaluated on *how* your solution addresses the assigned tasks.

2. Platform knowledge

    Does your code demonstrate your knowledge of the capabilities of the
    Java platform and its resources?

3. Coding style

    Is your coding style neat?  Does it fit in with the prevailing style of
    the project?  Is it idiomatic such that it will be easily understood by
    other Java developers?  Is it adequately (but not excessively)
    commented?

4. Working with git

    Good git usage is important for collaborating with other developers.
    Make sure each change is logically distinct (i.e. don't combine
    unrelated changes into a single "mega" commit).  Make sure the commit
    message for each change is meaningful.


Getting Started
---------------

### Clone the project to your local machine

You are probably reading this on GitHub already.  If not, you can find the
project [on GitHub](https://www.github.com/wyndhamjade/interview-test-java).

To begin work on the project, start by cloning the repository to your local
machine.  Do your work locally, committing your changes to your local git
repository as you go.

### Database & Dependencies

You are allowed to use any database of your choice along with any dependencies that may assist you in providing your solution.


Submitting Your Code For Evaluation
-----------------------------------

When you are finished and ready to submit your work, commit your changes to your local git repository and zip the repository:
